## What is it?

## Story
**You're a truther.** And you know that **aliens exist**. üëΩ Everyone knows that. You just need to convince them a little. So you **make crazy symbols in wheat** yourself!

However, not everyone is happy with it. Some **suspicious cows** or **a farm owner**, for instance... Will you create the symbols against the odds?
